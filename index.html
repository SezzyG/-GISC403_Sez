	<!-- EDIT THE DESCRIPTION HERE -->
	This map shows the hiking locations in the Kahurangi National Park where I went hiking with my brother, Ben at the end of 2022. It was my first “big” hike and was one I will forever cherish. It really made me realise just how lucky we are to live in such a beautiful country. The green dots represent key stops along our journey, with the yellow dots representing where we’re going to tackle when we head back. The orange polygon encompasses the majority of Kahurangi National Park as a whole with the light purple representing the territorial authority boundaries of New Zealand. Symbology was enhanced in Map Box, ensuring that the labels of mountains were easily legible, spaced and larger, to best prevent occlusion from the territorial authority layer. State highways were also enhanced by increasing the width with roads and walking tracks shown in black. I did struggle initially with the viewing scale of map box and the ways in which to alter the map appearance in general, however altered the colours of terrain to better distinguish terrain features.
